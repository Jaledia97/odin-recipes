    <h1>Shrimp Scampi</h1>
    <img src="../img/shrimp-scampi.jpeg" alt="A delicious plate of shrimp scampi">
    <p>This classic recipe makes a simple garlic, white wine and butter sauce that goes well with a pile of pasta or with a hunk of crusty bread. However you make the dish, once the shrimp are added to the pan, the trick is to cook them just long enough that they turn pink all over, but not until their bodies curl into rounds with the texture of tires.</p>
